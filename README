pyshortstringcompression
========================

Compress and decompress short strings.

We precompute a Huffman tree (dictionary) for our corpus, and this corpus
is not stored in any way in the compressed strings.

WARNING: When decompressing, make sure you know what dictionary was used
to compress the string, or you're hosed.

For happy porting, the compression dictionary is given in a human-readable
format. Pull requests should be directed at: https://github.com/antirez/smaz
